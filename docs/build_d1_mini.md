# Build instructions for (Wemos) D1 mini

- 1 [(Wemos) D1 mini](https://www.wemos.cc/en/latest/d1/d1_mini.html) or clone.
- 1 RJ12 connector and cable (6 wires)
- Optionally, hot melt glue and large heat shrink tubing.

Wiring is simple. Five of the pins from the connector (one pin is not used)...

And that is it. The result could look something like this:

Some hot-melt glue and heat shrink tubing will make it more robust though.
